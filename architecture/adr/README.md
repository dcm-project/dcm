# Architecture Decision Records

Short, reviewable summaries of the major architectural decisions in DCM. Each ADR answers **"Why does this exist and what does it do?"** — not implementation details.

**Required lens (every ADR / DecisionRecord).** Each decision MUST state its **Data · Policy · Provider** aspects — the three foundational abstractions (ADR-002). *Data* = what's modeled/held (UDLM); *Policy* = what's decided/computed/governed (DCM); *Provider* = what's declared as possible and what executes the mechanism. A decision that can't name all three (or explicitly say "n/a, because…") isn't fully scoped. This is foundational across UDLM and DCM (and any consumer).

**Reading order:** ADRs 001-003 establish the foundations. Read those first, then jump to whichever ADRs are relevant to your area.

> **ADRs and the UDLM `DecisionRecord`.** These ADRs are the human-authored, prose form of "why the architecture
> is the way it is." UDLM defines that same WHY as a first-class, machine-trackable record type — the
> **`DecisionRecord`** in the Knowledge entity-type family (`udlm/entities/knowledge-family.md` §4.5) — anchored to
> the capability/decision it justifies, paired with [Audit & Tamper Evidence](010-audit-tamper-evidence.md) and
> field-level provenance ([ADR-012](012-data-assembly-layering.md)). A `DecisionRecord` is the substrate-level,
> **validation-backed** counterpart of an ADR (it reaches `CANONICAL` only with passing use-case validation); the
> authoring/validation loop is realized by a conformant assessment realization (non-normative; nothing here depends on a specific tool). Adopt-by-reference per
> [ADR-021](021-adopting-external-standards.md): DCM records its decisions *as* UDLM DecisionRecords rather than a
> parallel form.

**DecisionRecord scope & validation.** A `DecisionRecord` is **scoped** (Data·Policy·Provider): **architecture-scoped** records are these ADRs; **policy-scoped** and **provider-scoped** records capture the *why* of a policy or a provider/capability adoption. A record reaches `CANONICAL` via **scope-appropriate validation** — *architecture:* use-case / conformance validation; *policy:* Policy-Engine validation + **Shadow Mode** (a `proposed` policy evaluated against real traffic, never applied); *provider:* attestation verification + conformance. This is **distinct from runtime decisions** (a policy firing, a provider selection), which are captured as **Audit + provenance** ([ADR-010](010-audit-tamper-evidence.md)), **not** DecisionRecords — a DecisionRecord is the deliberate *why* (authoring time, any scope); audit is *what happened* (runtime). The validation runner is therefore not one component but the scope's existing mechanism (conformance / Shadow Mode / attestation verification) — DCM-owned, no external dependency.

| [018](018-wire-serialization-event-conventions.md) | Wire Serialization & Event Conventions | snake_case payloads end-to-end (AEP-conformant; Go json tags, Python Pydantic native — no alias generator); CloudEvents envelope; event topics use lowercase dot-notation for broker wildcard routing — the runtime side of UDLM's data-model casing |

Credential API Selection) | Uphold·participate·expose a full trust model across 5 planes (PKI/mTLS, OAuth/OIDC, credential issuance, attestation, federation); DCM is a trust **broker**, not a credential authority; credentials brokered like placement (declare→select→attest, value direct CPX-001); security/trust/fit > portability; market-graded by profile; self-attested |

| [024](024-reference-resolution-and-change-impact.md) | Reference Resolution & Change-Impact Cascade | DCM resolves data references into the payload at assembly; consumes UDLM's transitive impact map; the cascade action (bump dependents) is a profile-governed policy (notify → propose → auto-adopt), never automatic — the policy counterpart to UDLM ADR-012 |
